      <h3>Locating code with iclass and other tools</h3>

The <b>iclass</b> program provides an easy way to locate C++ classes and cruise their hierarchical structures.
It is part of the <a href=./index.html>ivtools</a> source tree (borrowed from InterViews 3.1).
<b>iclass</b> reads in a set of C++ header files, builds the class structure
and displays several widgets containing the class information:
<ul>
<li> a string editor with the name of the current selected class</li>
<li> a list of the current selected class' base classes (parents)</li>
<li> a list of the current selected class' derived classes (children)</li>
<li> a text display of the current selected class definition</li>
<li> a list of all classes currently loaded into iclass</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can display a class definition by typing it into the string editor or
by clicking on any class name in a list widget.  It is a great way to
quickly browse a class hierarchy and to explore the classes contained in
any large C++ library.
<p>
To invoke <b>iclass</b> give it a list of header files to process, or use the
<code>-r</code> (recursive) option and give it a directory name; it will
descend recursively into the given directory structure loading all the
<code>.h</code> header files it can find there.  Some libraries (like vtk)
use <code>.hh</code> header filename extensions; we have modified iclass to make it recognize these files as well in recursive mode.

<p>
An alternative class browser is found in the 
<a href=http://www.infodock.com/manuals/oo-browser_toc.html>OO-Browser</a> package, a part of <A HREF="http://www.xemacs.org/">XEmacs</a>, which also contains <b>xoobr</b>,
an X Window tool that displays class trees graphically.
