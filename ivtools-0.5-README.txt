			README for ivtools 0.5


This directory contains a release of the ivtools 0.5.10 from Vectaport
Inc..  You should read the rest of this file for information on what
ivtools is and the INSTALL file for instructions on how to build it.
It is known to build with many versions of gcc (2.6.3, 2.7.2, 2.7.2.1)
and on a variety of Unix'es: SunOS 4.1 (MIT's X11R5), Solaris 5.2
(X11R6), Irix 5.2 (SGI's X11R5), Linux 1.2 (Slackware 3.0, XFree86
3.1) and Linux 2.0 (RedHat 4.0 and 4.1).  There is also a contributed
config for HPUX. You can pick up ELF binaries for Linux from the
ivtools web page (http://www.vectaport.com/ivtools/).

The overall copyright and permission notice for ivtools can be found
in the COPYRIGHT file in this directory.  If you have a question about
this software, desire to contribute code, found a bug, or wonder how
to get further assistance, please send e-mail to info@vectaport.com.

* What is ivtools?:

ivtools is a framework for building custom drawing editors and
servers.  It is a collection of C++ libraries and example programs
that incorporates and evolves the last source tree for InterViews 3.1
published by Stanford University and Silicon Graphics (3.2a.tar.Z).

ivtools comprises four sets of interrelated capabilities useful for
application programmers.  The first set is the libraries and example
programs we borrowed whole from InterViews 3.1.  The second set is for
reusing and extending the light-weight glyph objects of InterViews
3.1.  The third set reuses and extends the Unidraw library (Unidraw is
a major portion of the overall InterViews 3.1 release that provides an
application framework for custom drawing editors).  The fourth set
adds a command interpreter and server mechanism to ivtools, and
demonstrates these capabilities with text, glyph, and graphic
front-ends.

These are the libraries and example programs borrowed straight from
InterViews 3.1:

	IV		library of InterView 3.1, InterViews 2.6, Dispatch,
			OS, and TIFF objects
	dclock		digital clock with fading digits
	iclass		C++ class browser
	idemo		glyph demo 

These are the libraries and example programs that make up the glyph
part of ivtools (programs in the glyphs directory):

	IVGlyph		library of Glyph derived classes

	bdvtable        bounded-value editing 
	formdemo	value-editing 
	gclock		glyph-based clock
	meter           sliding meter
	radiogroup      radio-buttons
	scrollable	2d scrollable glyph
	scrollfield	2d scrollable field-editor
	strchooser	string chooser 
	text-editor     emacs-like text editor 
	timestamp	editable time glyph

These are the libraries and example programs that make up the Unidraw
part of ivtools:

	Unidraw		copy of Unidraw library from InterViews 3.1
	UniIdraw        librarification of 3.1 idraw 
	OverlayUnidraw  extended Unidraw framework
	Topology	spatial network library (nodes, edges, faces)
	GraphUnidraw    graph browser/editor library
	FrameUnidraw    multi-frame display mechanism

	idraw		idraw built on UniIdraw library
	drawtool        extended version of idraw built on OverlayUnidraw
	graphdraw       graph browser/editor integrated with drawtool
	flipbook        flipbook multi-frame editor based on drawtool

These are the libraries that make up the command interpreter part of
ivtools:

	ComUtil		command interpreter utility functions
	Attribute	attribute property list mechanism
	AttrGlyph	glyphs for Attribute library
	ComTerp		command interpreter objects
	ComGlyph	glyphs for ComTerp library	
	ComUnidraw      command interpreter augmentation
	DrawServ        drawing server framework

	comtest		test program
	comterp 	sample command interpreter 
	glyphterp	command interpreter user interface
	comdraw		drawtool with command interpreter
	drawserv        comdraw with graphs

There is also a Time library with Date and Time classes borrowed from
the NIH's class library.
	
A series of makefile targets support the checkin of sources to
cvs/rcs, and their subsequent update and modification.  This requires
cvs (at least 1.3) available from the Free Software Foundation and
ivmkcm-0.7 available through http://www.vectaport.com/ivmkcm/

The building of iv-3.1 with gcc-2.5.* (and subsequent versions)
was enabled by a patch from Adam Zell.
