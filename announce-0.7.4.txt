ivtools-0.7.4 now available.  Highlights:

	(by Rick Kissh)
	- shared memory support for loading rasters into the X server

	(by Rick Kissh)
	- asynchronous incremental download of rasters by URL.  Now
	you can pan and zoom the viewer, and draw/scale/rotate/move
	any graphic, all while watching the incremental progress of 
	the ongoing raster downloads.  Then for kicks, undo all your
	changes and get back to an unmodified fully downloaded
	drawing.  See this web page for an example:

		http://www.vectaport.com/ivtools/anteater-art.html

	- fairly complete HTML documentation, both online and in
	the tar file -- see

		http://www.vectaport.com/ivtools/doc/

	- Version 12 idraw format PostScript completes the support
	for floating point line width.  If a non-integer line width is
	used the resultant PostScript is not backward compatible.
	Versions of idraw since ivtools-0.6.7 will correctly detect
	and warn about this.  Prior versions will print a warning
	message like this:

		warning: drawing version 0 newer than idraw version 0

	which isn't very helpful.  See the FAQ for more info:

		http://www.vectaport.com/ivtools/faq.html#idrawversions

	
	- this release also re-incorporates most of the legacy glyph
	examples from the original InterViews 3.1 tar file and adds a
	test program to demonstrate that the ivtools Date class can
	handle the Y2K and Y2.038K problem.

	- lots of config changes for building on Solaris and Alpha
	(thanks to Dan DeJohn, Bruno DelFosse, and M. Rasit
	Eskicioglu).  See the ivtools FAQ for more hints on how to 
	build on any closed-source variant of Unix:
