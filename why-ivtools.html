    <a href=#MatureMenu name="Mature">*</a> mature framework for direct-manipulation graphical editors<p>

ivtools is a mature framework for  constructing custom drawing editors and  <a href=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DirectManipulation>direct manipulation</a> user interfaces.
Starting with <a href=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JohnVlissides>John Vlissides'</a> 
<a href=./unidrawinfo.html>Unidraw</a>, we've added <a href=./techinfo.html>layers</a> of 
class libraries for graph and frame visualization, <a href=./largeimage.html>image</a> 
display and <a href=./plotutils.html>plot</a> importing, as well as augmenting the original software with 
support for alternate document formats, command interpreting, attribute (property-list) management, 
and networking capabilities.<p>

    <a href=#LightweightMenu name="Lightweight">*</a> lightweight glyphs for interactive structured document applications<p>

The <a href=./interviews.html>InterViews</a> team was among the first
to explore the concept of light-weight user interface objects, where
pick and layout are managed on the client side. They used a single X window
for a complex glyph layout, shifting more of the rendering logic to
the client.  The client gets finer grained control and the X server is
left to do what it does best, paint raster and vector graphics.  <p>

This approach had been pioneered with the structured graphics
capability of InterViews 2.6.  Now with glyphs the same performance
advantages were brought to conventional widget objects (button,
slider, menus, etc..).  The improvement relative to Motif for a
complicated dialog box was quite noticeable, hence the term
"flyweight".  In addition these glyphs were put to the test in
creating doc, a document editor with TeX like capabilities where C++
objects were used down to the single character level.  You can read
more on this <a href=./ivtools-layers.html>here</a><p>

    <a href=#SeparationMenu name>*</a> separation of structured graphic and structured document classes<p>

ivtools (and InterViews 3.1) has separate sets of objects for
structured graphics and structured douments.  Fresco has a single set
of classes for structured graphics and structured documents.
Unification of these two different fields of applications is
interesting, but in our opinion unnecessarily complicates the API and
the debugging process if all you really want is a custom drawing
editor.  It seems either you're building a pure graphical interface,
where no automated layout is required, or your building a
boxes-and-glue interface where you want all the power of TeX under the
hood.  In ivtools these classes are still separate, and different
programmers can specialize in one or the other. <p>
    
    <a href=#IntegrationMenu name="Integration">*</a> integration of an extendable and distributed command interpreter<p>

The command interpreter can be used within applications built on  ivtools as a calculator for computing arbitrary attribute values, for selecting objects in a drawing
editor by evaluating an arbitrary attribute expression, for controlling the viewer mechanism of
a drawing editor and the playback mechanism of a flipbook viewer, and even for scripted drawing of graphics
as an alternate to manual interactive creation.  All of these are available for reuse in custom
applications.<p>

In their <a href=http://www.acm.org/pubs/toc/Abstracts/tois/98197.html>ACM paper on Unidraw</a>, Linton
and Vlissides concluded with a discussion of what could be done to further extend the usefulness of
the framework.  One thing they mentioned was the ability to interpret external formats, thus translating
them into an internal representation that can be saved/restored, and exported to other formats.  
You could almost already do this with ivtools, because 
the language used to save/restore documents is the same one recognized by the 
<a href=./comterp.html>command interpreter</a>.   A given interpreter, like that in <a href=./comdraw.html>comdraw</a> could be expanded with a new function
for each object type in the specialized application document. <p>
    
    <a href=#FreedomMenu name="Freedom">*</a> freedom to use the source in any fashion<p>

ivtools is <a href=http://www.opensource.org>open source</a> and 
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/categories.html#Non-CopyleftedFreeSoftware">non-copylefted</a> 
X Consortium style free software.  This means you can use it for both free-software projects and
commercial software development.  You can even GPL or LGPL your copy if you so desire, but we'll carry
on with the license the way it is, the way it has always been <a href=./caveats.html>*</a>.  There is no document guaranteeing this,
but the logic behind Vectaport's business should be self-evident.  We make money off of selling service,
training, and CD-ROMs.  Our customers are in the business of making custom, often proprietary, 
applications.  They understand the advantage of leveraging a freely available foundation of
generic software with few strings attached. <i> Vectaport ceased existence as a corporation Dec 31st 2000, but continues as a web site and consulting venue for <a href="http://www.vectaport.com/johnston/">Scott Johnston</a></i><p>

Ok, there is a string or two.  The <a href=../vectaport/copyrights.html>copyright notices</a> we used are
derived from the X11 copyright, and require that you include the entire copyright and permission notice
at least once, somewhere in the documentation, in any derivative work, and that at least the single 
copyright line itself remain in the source code.  

And that you not use the name of any copyright holder in any form of publicity or advertising without permission.  <p>

    <a href=#ProtectionMenu name="Protection">*</a> protection from software patents<p>

This is an interesting advantage of  ivtools (and InterViews 3.1).  All of the core mechanisms of the
drawing editors, flyweight glyphs, and command interpreters were published in source or paper form in
the late 1980s or early 1990s.  With a decade head-start on the forces of patent litigation, you
can feel about as safe investing in this software technology as you can hope for.  Not only in your ability
to win if taken to court, but in your ability to stay out of court and brush off nuisance licensors,
by flooding them with a collection of long-time URL's that convincingly demonstrate prior art.  The
original <a href=ftp://interviews.stanford.edu>interviews.stanford.edu</a> ftp site is still up and running, though nothing has changed on it 
for years.<p>

    <a href=#ContinualMenu name="Continual">*</a> continual commercial-quality development and support<p>

At Vectaport we've been programming with InterViews 3.1  and derivative source code 
since 1993.  Our experience with InterViews started with using InterViews 2.6 in 1990.  And the 
initial development for the command interpreter embedded into ivtools was undertaken as early as
1988.  <i> Vectaport ceased existence as a corporation Dec 31st 2000, but continues as a web site and consulting venue for <a href="http://www.vectaport.com/johnston/">Scott Johnston</a></i><p>

Though some of the code is old, some of the code is always new.  We
continually develop and release these frameworks, incrementally adding
capability month after month, year after year.  We take care to make
sure any changes to the API or implementation of existing classes are
the kind that can safely be propogated by recompiling the C++ source.
Unlike C API's, where people respect finished and unchanging libraries
of code, these C++ frameworks are continually changing, continually
growing, and continually being improved, all in a way that doesn't
upset any particularily static use of the classes as they existed at
some prior time.  To prove this we continually seek out static
InterViews applications, like MixViews, and test that they can still
be built on top of ivtools.<p>

    <a href=#OrganizedMenu name="Organized">*</a> organized leverage of other software frameworks<p>

Is a nice drawing editor not enough reason to consider using ivtools?
Then what about a powerful middleware package for networking and
system services, a collection of frameworks for image understanding, a
sound-editing application, packages for geo-spatial map rendering in
2d and 3d and vehicle simulation for navigating those maps?  All of
these are software packages that work together with <a
href=./index.html>ivtools</a>, software packages where we have done
the initial interfacing or integration work, and published the results
for others to use.  <p>

    <a href=#OpenMenu name="Open">*</a> open coordination of distributed development via patch<p>

You'll find no centralized use of cvs at vectaport.com, because we appreciate the right of any
programmer to manage their own copies of the source they rely on, 
and to incorporate the changes of third parties whenever they please.  We see no need to force them
to upgrade with everyone elses latest changes as a pre-requisite for committing and
distributing their own changes (the cvs model of coordinating development).   Instead we use cvs as
a personal or  local-area tool for configuration management and for generating patches for sharing
with remote sites.  The wizardry of patch is that it can allow disparate programmers to share
improvements between source trees of similar lineage, without ever absolutely requiring the
merging or unification of the source trees.  If and when this is done is up to the programmers,
not the tool.  If a particular configuration of software is well-suited and well-tested for a 
well-defined application, what is wrong with it never changing again, or only changing to incorporate
necessary bug fixes while ignoring any unnecessary enhancements or extensions?<p>

However, the converse question can also be asked.  What is wrong with incorporating unnecessary enhancements
and extensions if the stable application still compiles, links, and works?  We've found a typical approach 
of third party developers is to remain with a stable release of ivtools while building their own
applications, incorporating only the patches they need for the particular bugs they find or new
features they need.  Then, if and when they have the time, they upgrade to the latest version of ivtools.<p>
