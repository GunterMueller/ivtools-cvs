targetjr-3.1 has successfully been built with ivtools substituted for
InterViews on Linux.  Instructions can be found at
http://www.vectaport.com/ivtools/targetjr-3.1.txt.  It is almost as
simple as substituting a different pathname for the --with-iv argument
of the configure script.  ivtools can be obtained via
http://www.vectaport.com/ivtools/ or as part of the recently announced
Debian 2.0 Linux distribution.

ivtools contains alternate backward-compatible copies of the original
InterViews and Unidraw libraries from Stanford University, and
augments them with layered frameworks for Motif look-and-feel,
large-scale imagery, and multi-frame and graph-network edit and
display.  It builds in support for arbitrary numeric rasters (char,
short, int, long, float, double) and a variety of image enhancement
operators (for display purposes) to the Unidraw application framework.
It has been used on a variety of US government funded projects (NASA,
ARPA), and is constantly maintained and upgraded by Vectaport Inc..
Documentation for ivtools is available online and via CD-ROM.  With a
free software copyright identical to InterViews and similar to Target
Jr, ivtools may be worth considering for the IU developer working on
large-scale custom applications with a focus on Unix and 2D imaging.
