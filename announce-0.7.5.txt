ivtools-0.7.5 is now available from http://www.vectaport.com/ivtools/.
This release features an improved configure script (no longer any need
to supply CPU, PWD, XCONFIGDIR, or GPLUSPLUSINCLUDEDIR make
variables), automatic re-centering of rasters read from URLs, and full
animation of direct-manipulation graphic transformations
(move/scale/stretch/rotate).

ivtools is a collection of extendable drawing editors and spatial data
servers.  It is also a layered application framework with support for
vector and raster graphics, multi-view document editing, networking,
scripting, components, and serialization.  An alternate to Java Swing
or MFC for the Unix/X11/C++ programmer.

Documentation available online (http://www.vectaport.com/ivtools/doc/)
as well as downloadable in a tar file of HTML and other files, all
copyrighted identical to ivtools (X11 style):
