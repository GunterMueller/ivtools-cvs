    <h1>ivtools licensing caveats</h1>

From <a href=./why-ivtools.html>why-ivtools.html</a>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>but we'll carry on with the license the way it is, the way it has always been</i> 

<p>
That'll teach me to state things with such absolute certainty.  Since
writing that I've come to realize there might be future circumstances
that would merit some evolution to the copyright permission notice of
ivtools.  Whoa, that doesn't mean it's gonna get all proprietary.
Read on.
<p>
It could happen that some organization would be interested in
making significant contributions to ivtools if their work could receive some of the
protections offered by licenses like the Free Software Foundation's
LGPL.  In that event, to protect the interests of the stakeholders in
ivtools, I would consider making changes to the license, but these
changes would be limited as follows:

<menu>
<li>There would be no additional restrictions placed on binary distributions</li>
<li>Additional restrictions on source distributions would not apply to
any derivative C++ classes that were seeded by cloning ivtools classes or to any larger work in which it was embedded (i.e. the license would not be viral in these cases).</li>
<li>The new license would conform to the <a href=http://www.debian.org>Debian</a> Free Software Guidelines</li>
<li>The new license would conform to the <a href=http://www.fsf.org>Free Software Foundation's</a> definition of free software</li>
</menu>
<p>

Recently (with ivtools-0.7.4, Feb. 27th 1999), a <a
href=./COPYRIGHT.proposed.txt>COPYRIGHT.proposed</a> was added to the
ivtools source tree that attempts some of the above.  All the comments
received to date have been neutral or opposed to the change.  So it
looks unlikely this will be adopted with ivtools-0.8.
