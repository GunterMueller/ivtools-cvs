<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A Selection manages a set of distinguished graphical  com-
       ponent   views,  usually  those  in  which  the  user  has
       expressed interest by selecting them with a tool  or  com-
       mand.  Each selection object maintains a list of graphical
       component views  and  provides  operations  for  iterating
       through  and manipulating the list.  Components, commands,
       tools, and editors often rely on  one  or  more  selection
       objects to supply the components on which they operate.

<H2>PUBLIC OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>Selection(Selection*</B> <B>=</B> <B>nil)</B>
              Create  a new selection object, optionally contain-
              ing references to  the  same  views  as  the  given
              selection object.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>~Selection()</B>
              Destroy  a selection instance.  Deleting the selec-
              tion does <I>not</I> in turn delete the view instances  it
              maintains.

       <B>void</B> <B>Show(Viewer*</B> <B>=</B> <B>nil)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>Update(Viewer*</B> <B>=</B> <B>nil)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>Hide(Viewer*</B> <B>=</B> <B>nil)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>Init(Viewer*</B> <B>=</B> <B>nil)</B>
              These operations affect how the selection is repre-
              sented visually in the viewer.  Show instructs  the
              views to initialize and draw their handles to high-
              light themselves, thus  indicating  that  they  are
              selected.  To do so, it calls RedrawHandles on each
              view.   Update  makes  handles  of  newly-selected,
              unhighlighted  views  appear by calling DrawHandles
              on all its views.  Hide unhighlights the  views  by
              calling  their  EraseHandles  operation.   Finally,
              Init initializes each view's handles without  draw-
              ing  them (in case the handles' appearance may have
              changed) by calling InitHandles on each.

       <B>void</B> <B>Clear(Viewer*</B> <B>=</B> <B>nil)</B>
              Remove all views from the Selection object,  hiding
              their handles in the process.

       <B>void</B> <B>Append(GraphicView*)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>Prepend(GraphicView*)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>InsertAfter(Iterator,</B> <B>GraphicView*)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>InsertBefore(Iterator,</B> <B>GraphicView*)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>Remove(Iterator&amp;)</B>
              Operations  for  modifying  the selection's list of
              views.  Append and Prepend add a GraphicView to the
              end  and  the  beginning of the list, respectively.
              InsertAfter and InsertBefore insert  a  GraphicView
              after  and before the GraphicView pointed to by the
              iterator,  respectively.   The  Remove   operations
              remove  a view from the list (without deleting it).
              You can remove a view instance by referring  to  it
              explicitly  or  by  specifying  an iterator.  If an
              iterator is supplied,  the  Remove  operation  will
              advance it to point to the following view as a side
              effect.

       <B>GraphicView*</B> <B>GetView(Iterator)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>SetView(GraphicView*,</B> <B>Iterator&amp;)</B>
              GetView returns  the  view  to  which  an  iterator
              points.   SetView  initializes an iterator to point
              to a particular view in the  list;  it  initializes
              the  iterator  to  point  to  a nil instance if the
              given GraphicView is not in the selection list.

       <B>void</B> <B>First(Iterator&amp;)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>Last(Iterator&amp;)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>Next(Iterator&amp;)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>Prev(Iterator&amp;)</B>
       <B>boolean</B> <B>Done(Iterator)</B>
              Operations for iterating over the  selection  list.
              First  and  Last initialize an iterator to point to
              the beginning and end of  the  list,  respectively.
              Next  increments  the iterator to point to the fol-
              lowing view, while Prev decrements the iterator  to
              point  to the preceding view.  Done returns whether
              or not the iterator points beyond the first or last
              view in the list.

       <B>boolean</B> <B>IsEmpty()</B>
       <B>boolean</B> <B>Includes(GraphicView*)</B>
       <B>int</B> <B>Number()</B>
              Operations that return information about the selec-
              tion object's contents.   IsEmpty  returns  whether
              the  selection  list  is  empty,  Includes  returns
              whether the list contains the given view, and  Num-
              ber returns the number of views in the list.

       <B>void</B> <B>Sort(GraphicView*)</B>
              Sort  the views in the selection list to conform to
              their order in  the  given  GraphicView's  list  of
              children.    The  selection  list's  order  usually
              reflects the order in which the user  selected  the
              objects,  not  their order in their parent. Sort is
              useful in operations that modify or depend  on  the

       <B>void</B> <B>Exclusive(Selection*)</B>
              Operations  that change the selection object's con-
              tents based on another selection's.  Merge adds the
              views  in  the  given selection to those already in
              the selection object (the union of the  two  sets),
              while  Exclusive  adds  those  views not already in
              this object and removes those common to  both  (the
              union  minus  the  intersection  of  the two sets).
              Neither of these operations change the contents  of
              their argument.

       <B>void</B> <B>GetBox(Coord&amp;,</B> <B>Coord&amp;,</B> <B>Coord&amp;,</B> <B>Coord&amp;)</B>
              Return the bounding box circumscribing the views in
              the selection list.

<H2>PROTECTED OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>UList*</B> <B>Elem(Iterator)</B>
       <B>GraphicView*</B> <B>View(UList*)</B>
              Selection stores its views on  a  UList,  which  is
              accessible  via  the  <B>_</B><I>ulist</I> protected member.  The
              Selection's iteration operations  store  the  UList
              containing  the  current  view  in  their iterator.
              Elem is a convenience function  for  returning  the
              UList   to  which  an  iterator  points,  and  View
              extracts the GraphicView that a UList element  con-
              tains.
