<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Unidraw  is  an  architecture for creating object-oriented
       graphical editors in domains such as technical and  artis-
       tic   drawing,  music  composition,  and  circuit  design.
       Unidraw simpifies the construction  of  these  editors  by
       providing  programming abstractions that are common across
       domains.  Unidraw defines four basic abstractions:  <B>compo-</B>
       <B>nents</B>  encapsulate the appearance and semantics of objects
       in a domain, <B>tools</B> support direct manipulation  of  compo-
       nents,  <B>commands</B> define operations on components and other
       objects, and <B>external</B> <B>representations</B> define  the  mapping
       between  components  and  the file format generated by the
       editor.  Unidraw also supports multiple  views,  graphical
       connectivity  and confinement, and dataflow between compo-
       nents.

       The Unidraw library contains a collection of classes  that
       implement  the  Unidraw architecture.  The Unidraw library
       is used together with the rest of InterViews,  except  the
       <I>graphic</I>  structured  graphics  library, to develop domain-
       specific graphical object editors.  InterViews interactors
       and  composition  mechanisms support an application's look
       and feel, while the Unidraw library supports functionality
       unique   to  graphical  object  editors.   Currently,  the
       Unidraw  library  provides  its  own  structured  graphics
       classes,  which  are  similar to but incompatible with the
       graphic library classes.  Therefore you must not use  both
       graphic and Unidraw classes in the same application.

       General  Unidraw  classes  are declared in header files in
       the Unidraw include file subdirectory. Component, command,
       tool, and structured graphics classes are declared in cor-
       responding subdirectories under the Unidraw  subdirectory.
