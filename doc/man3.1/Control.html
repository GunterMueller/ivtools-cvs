       Control, ControlState - select and execute an action


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;InterViews/control.h&gt;</B>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A  control  is  a  monoscene  that  allows an action to be
       selected and executed.  The component of a control  deter-
       mines  the appearance associated with the control.  A con-
       trol state is  a  subject  that  coordinates  a  group  of
       related controls.  The control state contains a pointer to
       the currently selected control (if any).

       Controls are useful for grabbing  input  and  moving  over
       potentially   selectable   items.   Examples  of  controls
       include popup menus, pull-down menus, and menu items.   It
       is generally not necessary to call functions directly on a
       control.

<H2>PUBLIC OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>Control(Interactor*)</B>
              Construct a new control with the  given  interactor
              as the component.

       <B>~Control</B>
              Destruct   a  control.   Because  a  control  is  a
              monoscene, deleting it implies deleting its  compo-
              nent interactor.

       <B>ControlState*</B> <B>State()</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>SetState(ControlState*)</B>
              Get or set the control state associated with a con-
              trol.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Handle(Event&amp;)</B>
              Controls  are  initially  inactive.   A   DownEvent
              causes  a  control  to become active.  If an active
              control receives an EnterEvent,  it  will  set  the
              current  selection to itself.  If an active control
              receives a LeaveEvent,  it  will  set  the  current
              selection to <I>nil</I>.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Enable(boolean)</B>
       <B>boolean</B> <B>Enabled()</B>
              Depending on the argument, Enable enables (<I>true</I>) or
              disables (<I>false</I>) the control.   Control  subclasses
              can  check  whether the control is enabled with the
              Enabled operation and then take whatever action  is
              appropriate.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Select()</B>
              Highlight  the  control and call the protected vir-
              Call the protected virtual function Close and  then
              unhighlight the control.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Do()</B>
              Implement  a  selected action.  When a control sees
              an UpEvent, it calls Do on the current selection.

       <B>Control*</B> <B>ParentControl()</B>
       <B>Control*</B> <B>RootControl()</B>
              The control hierarchy does not  necessarily  corre-
              spond  to  the  interactor hierarchy.  These opera-
              tions return the control's parent  control  or  the
              root  of  the control hierarchy, if any, as defined
              by control subclasses.

<H2>PROTECTED OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Down()</B>
       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Up()</B>
              Down and Up are called when the control receives  a
              DownEvent   and   an   UpEvent,  respectively.   By
              default,  Down  activates  the  control  if  it  is
              enabled,  and  Up deactivates the control and calls
              Do on the current selection.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Enter()</B>
       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Leave()</B>
              Enter makes the control the current selection if it
              is  enabled  and  active, while Leave nullifies the
              current selection if the  control  is  enabled  and
              active.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Open()</B>
       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Close()</B>
              The  base class Open and Close do nothing, but sub-
              classes may insert and remove an  interactor,  such
              as a pull-down menu.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Grab()</B>
              Grab  reads  input and only passes through an event
              if its target is an active control.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Skip()</B>
              Skip reads and discards input events until it reads
              an  event targetted for a control that is currently
              grabbing input, as  indicated  by  IsGrabbing  (see
              below).

       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Busy()</B>
       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Done()</B>
              The Up operation calls Busy just before it calls Do
              on the target, and it calls Done immediately after-
              wards.   These  operations  do  nothing by default;

       <B>virtual</B> <B>boolean</B> <B>IsGrabbing(Interactor*)</B>
              IsGrabbing returns true if the given interactor  is
              grabbing control.

       <B>void</B> <B>Reparent(Control*</B> <B>target,</B> <B>Control*</B> <B>parent)</B>
              Set  <I>target</I>'s parent to <I>parent</I>.  Controls that com-
              pose child controls should call this  operation  on
              their children.
