       UArray - dynamic array class


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;Unidraw/uarray.h&gt;</B>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       UArray implements a dynamic array, that is, one that grows
       as elements are added.  It can also act as a linked  list,
       allowing  insertion  and  removal  of  objects, though the
       overhead for such operations  is  generally  greater  than
       that  for conventional doubly-linked list implementations.
       However, the overhead per  stored  object  is  potentially
       much  less  for  a  UArray, and objects can be accessed by
       index in constant time.

<H2>PUBLIC OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>UArray(int</B> <B>=</B> <B>16)</B>
              Create a new UArray instance, optionally  providing
              an  estimate of its maximum size.  While specifying
              the size is not  required,  supplying  an  accurate
              estimate will improve performance.

       <B>void*&amp;</B> <B>operator[](int</B> <B>index)</B>
              Overloading  the brackets operator allows access to
              the UArray's elements with the standard array nota-
              tion.   Note  that  type  information  is lost when
              retrieving objects from the UArray, requiring cast-
              ing.

       <B>void</B> <B>Insert(void*,</B> <B>int</B> <B>index)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>Remove(int</B> <B>index)</B>
              Insert  and remove an object at a particular index,
              moving the succeeding objects up or down one  posi-
              tion as required.

       <B>int</B> <B>Index(void*)</B>
              Return  the  given  object's  index  in the UArray,
              returning -1 if the object does not appear  in  the
              UArray.

       <B>int</B> <B>Count()</B>
              Return  the  number of objects inserted in the UAr-
              ray.

       <B>void</B> <B>Clear()</B>
              Clear the UArray, reducing the number of object  it
              contains to zero.
