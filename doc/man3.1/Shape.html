       Shape - what shape a canvas should have


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;InterViews/shape.h&gt;</B>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A shape specifies the desired characteristics of a canvas.
       An interactor should set the fields of its shape  when  it
       is  reconfigured  and  should call Change on its parent if
       any of these fields change.

       The dimensions of a shape are  defined  by  a  ``natural''
       size,  a  stretch  amount, and a shrink amount.  The <I>width</I>
       and  <I>height</I>  fields  indicate  the  desired  sizes.    The
       <I>hstretch</I>,  <I>vstretch</I>,  <I>hshrink</I>,  <I>vshrink</I>  fields define how
       flexible these desired sizes are.  For example, an  inter-
       actor  may  have a natural size of 100, but can adequately
       handle any size between 50 and  200.   The  stretchability
       for this case would be 100 and the shrinkability 50.

       The  constants  <I>hfil</I>  and  <I>vfil</I>  are  provided to indicate
       ``infinite'' stretching or  shrinking.   They  are  repre-
       sented  as  very large numbers and manipulated exactly the
       same as other stretch and shrink parameters.

       The <I>aspect</I> field specifies the desired  aspect  ratio.   A
       value of zero means any aspect is acceptable.

       The  <I>hunits</I>  and  <I>vunits</I>  fields  indicate that the canvas
       dimensions should be multiples of some values.

<H2>PUBLIC OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>Shape()</B>
              Construct a new shape with undefined  natural  size
              and  infinite  stretchability  and shrinkability in
              both directions.

       <B>boolean</B> <B>Defined()</B>
       <B>boolean</B> <B>Undefined()</B>
              Test if the shape's natural size is defined or not.

       <B>void</B> <B>Rect(int</B> <B>width,</B> <B>int</B> <B>height)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>Square(int</B> <B>side)</B>
              Short-hand for setting the dimensions of the shape.
              Square sets both dimensions to <I>side</I>  and  sets  the
              aspect ratio to one.

       <B>void</B> <B>Rigid(int</B> <B>hshrink,</B> <B>int</B> <B>hstretch,</B> <B>int</B> <B>vshrink,</B> <B>int</B>
              <B>vstretch)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>Rigid()</B>
              Set the stretchability and shrinkability fields  of
              the  shape.   If  no  arguments  are specified, the
              Reset the shape's natural size to be undefined.
