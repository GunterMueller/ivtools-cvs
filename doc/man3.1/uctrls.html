       CommandControl,  PanelControl,  HPanelControl,  VPanelCon-
       trol,  CommandInteractor,  PanelInteractor  -   predefined
       UControl and UControlInteractor subclasses for common con-
       trols

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       CommandControl is a UControl subclass that executes a Com-
       mand.   CommandControl instances are most commonly used in
       menus.  CommandInteractor is a UControlInteractor subclass
       that CommandControls create to define their appearance.

       PanelControl  is  a  subclass  of UControl that provides a
       radiobutton-like interface to  selecting  from  a  set  of
       mutually-exclusive  choices.   A PanelControl is passed an
       interactor when it is created to  define  its  appearance.
       PanelControls  are  often  used  to create ``palettes'' of
       interactors that engage the current Tool instance.

       PanelInteractor  is  a  UControlInteractor  subclass  that
       defines an appearance that is often appropriate for Panel-
       Controls.  HPanelControl and VPanelControl are  subclasses
       of  PanelControl  that  use  PanelInteractor  instances by
       default.

       <B>CommandControl(const</B> <B>char*,</B> <B>ControlInfo*)</B>
              Create a CommandControl,  optionally  supplying  an
              instance name.  The constructors automatically cre-
              ate and insert a ControlInteractor  to  define  the
              CommandControl's appearance.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Do()</B>
              If the ControlInfo's owner is a reversible command,
              then Do will create a copy of the command,  execute
              it,  and log it (if it remains reversible following
              execution).  If the owner is an  irreversible  com-
              mand,  then  Do  will execute it without copying or
              logging it.

<H2>COMMANDINTERACTOR PUBLIC OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>CommandInteractor(ControlInfo*)</B>
              Create a  CommandInteractor  with  the  given  Con-
              trolInfo  object.   The  CommandInteractor displays
              the ControlInfo's label and  keylabel  side-by-side
              as would befit a menu entry.

<H2>PANELCONTROL PUBLIC OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>PanelControl(Interactor*,</B> <B>ControlInfo*,</B> <B>ControlState*</B> <B>=</B>
           <B>const</B> <B>char*,</B> <B>Interactor*,</B> <B>ControlInfo*,</B>
           <B>ControlState*</B> <B>=</B> <B>nil</B>
       <B>)</B>
              Create a PanelControl, supplying an interactor that
              defines  its  appearance, a ControlInfo object, and
              optionally an instance  name  and  a  ControlState,
              which  all  PanelControls in a palette should share
              to ensure mutual exclusion.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Do()</B>
              Do simply calls Down.  Thus when  the  KeyMap  exe-
              cutes the keyboard equivalent specified in the Con-
              trolInfo, it has the same effect as clicking on the
              PanelControl instance.

              HPanelControls  and VPanelControls simply create an
              instance of PanelInteractor and pass it to the Pan-
              elControl  constructor.   HPanelControls  should be
              used in row-oriented palettes,  and  VPanelControls
              should be used in column-oriented palettes.


</PRE>
<H2>PANELINTERACTOR PUBLIC OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>PanelInteractor(ControlInfo*,</B> <B>Orientation)</B>
              Create a PanelInteractor with the given orientation
              and ControlInfo object.  The  PanelInteractor  will
              draw  the  ControlInfo's label in the center of its
              canvas and the keylabel in the lower right.   Hori-
              zontal  orientation is appropriate for row-oriented
              instances, while Vertical orientation is  appropri-
              ate for column-oriented instances.
