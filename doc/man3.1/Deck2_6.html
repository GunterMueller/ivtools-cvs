       Deck - a stack of interactors on top of each other


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;InterViews/deck.h&gt;</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A  deck is a scene containing interactors that are concep-
       tually stacked on top of each other.  Only one  interactor
       is  visible  at  a  time.   A  deck is useful to implement
       ``paging'' through a document, or where only one  of  sev-
       eral similar components should be visible at a time, as in
       applications using alternate tool pallets  or  menus  with
       alternate entries.

       A  deck will try to stretch or shrink the visible interac-
       tor to fill the total space.  The natural size of  a  deck
       is the maximum of its components.

       A  deck uses its <I>perspective</I> to specify which component is
       visible.  The components are  numbered  in  the  order  in
       which  they are inserted into the deck, starting with one.
       A scroller or other interactor which operates on the  per-
       spective can be used to allow a user to specify the compo-
       nent to view.  Either horizontal or vertical scrolling can
       be used.

<H2>PUBLIC OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>Deck()</B> Construct a new deck.

       <B>void</B> <B>Insert(Interactor*)</B>
              Add an interactor to the deck.

       <B>void</B> <B>Change(Interactor*)</B>
              Notify  the  deck  that  an  interactor's shape has
              changed.  If propagation is on, the deck recomputes
              its own shape and notifies its parent.

       <B>void</B> <B>Remove(Interactor*)</B>
              Take an interactor out of a deck.

       <B>void</B> <B>Flip(int</B> <B>count</B> <B>=</B> <B>1)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>FlipTo(int</B> <B>position)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>Top()</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>Bottom()</B>
              Perform  operations  on  the perspective to specify
              the component to view.  Flip specifies  the  compo-
              nent relative to the current component.  A positive
              value of <I>count</I> specifies a component nearer to  the
              ``bottom''  of  the  deck  (the components inserted
              last), and a negative value specifies  a  component
              nearer  to  the ``top''.  FlipTo specifies a compo-
              nent by its absolute position in the deck.  A posi-
              a  position  from  the bottom, starting at -1.  Top
              and  Bottom  are  equivalent   to   <B>FlipTo(1)</B>   and
              FlipTo(-1) respectively.
