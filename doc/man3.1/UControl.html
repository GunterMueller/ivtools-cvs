       UControl,  UControlInteractor  - base classes for menu and
       button interfaces that work with ControlInfo objects


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;Unidraw/uctrl.h&gt;</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       UControl is an abstract class  that  augments  InterViews'
       Control  base  class  to  deal  with Unidraw's ControlInfo
       objects, which define a keyboard equivalent for  the  con-
       trol.   UControlInteractor  is  an abstract base class for
       interactors that base their appearance on the  information
       in  a  ControlInfo  object.   UControl  subclasses can use
       UControlInteractor subclasses to define their  appearance.

       Unidraw-based applications needn't use UControls and UCon-
       trolInteractors to help define  their  look  and  feel  if
       Unidraw's keyboard equivalent mechanism is not needed.

              UControl provides protected constructors  that  let
              subclasses  initialize  the  ControlInfo object and
              optionally specify their instance name.

              trolInfo object.

              The UControlInteractor's appearance is defined by a
              Graphic object, which it builds from information in
              its ControlInfo object.  By default, UControlInter-
              actor highlights itself  by  drawing  this  graphic
              with its foreground and background colors reversed.

       <B>UControlInteractor(ControlInfo*)</B>
       <B>UControlInteractor()</B>
              UControlInteractor defines two protected  construc-
              tors.   One  takes the ControlInfo object to use as
              an argument.  This constructor also initializes the
              UControlInteractor's  <B>_</B><I>label</I>  protected  member  by
              initializes <B>_</B><I>label</I> to nil.  Both constructors  ini-
              tialize the UControlInteractor's <B>_</B><I>picture</I> protected
              member to point to an instance of a Picture object,
              which  defines the UControlInteractor's appearance.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Invert()</B>
              Invert reverses <B>_</B><I>picture's</I> colors  without  drawing
              it.

       <B>Graphic*</B> <B>InitLabel(ControlInfo*)</B>
              Create  a  graphic from the information stored in a
              ControlInfo object that defines the  UControlInter-
              actor's   appearance.   This  operation  creates  a
              GraphicView of the  ControlInfo's  GraphicComp  and
              returns a copy of the view's graphic.
