       SplineComp,    SplineView,   PSSpline,   ClosedSplineComp,
       ClosedSplineView, PSClosedSpline - open and closed  spline

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       SplineComp and  ClosedSplineComp  are  VerticesComps  that
       define  open and closed splines, respectively.  SplineComp
       uses an SFH_OpenBSpline graphic  to  store  its  graphical
       attributes,  while  ClosedSplineComp  uses an SFH_ClosedB-
       Spline.  SplineView and ClosedSplineView are VerticesViews
       for  displaying  open  and  closed  splines.  PSSpline and
       PSClosedSpline are PSVertices that externalize their  sub-
       ject's information in PostScript form.

       <B>SplineComp(SFH_OpenBSpline*</B> <B>=</B> <B>nil)</B>
              The  constructor  takes  an  optional control point
              hit-detecting stroked-filled open B-spline  graphic
              that defines the attributes of the spline.

       <B>SFH_OpenBSpline*</B> <B>GetSpline()</B>
              Return the SFH_OpenBSpline graphic that defines the
              spline's attributes.  GetSpline is  simply  a  more
              specific form of the GetGraphic operation.

<H2>SPLINEVIEW PUBLIC OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>SplineView(SplineComp*</B> <B>=</B> <B>nil)</B>
              Create  a SplineView, optionally supplying the sub-
              ject.

       <B>)</B>

       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>InterpretManipulator(Manipulator*)</B>
              SplineView redefines its response  to  manipulation
              with  a  GraphicCompTool.  The user clicks the left
              mouse button to specify each vertex and clicks with
              the  middle  mouse button to specify the final ver-
              tex.  Vertex positioning  will  be  constrained  by
              gravity,   if   any.   SplineView  also  defines  a
              response to the ReshapeTool, allowing the  user  to
              click  on  one  of its control points to reposition
              it.   The  subject  is   actually   replaced   (via
              ReplaceCmd)  with a new SplineComp subject reflect-
              ing the repositioned control point.   Repositioning
              will be influenced by gravity.

              Return the subject.


</PRE>
<H2>PSSPLINE PUBLIC OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>PSSpline(SplineComp*</B> <B>=</B> <B>nil)</B>
              Construct  a  PostScript external representation of
              the given subject, if any.


</PRE>
<H2>PSSPLINE PROTECTED OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>virtual</B> <B>const</B> <B>char*</B> <B>Name()</B>
              PSSpline  identifies  itself  as  "BSpl"   in   the
              PostScript output.


</PRE>
<H2>CLOSEDSPLINECOMP PUBLIC OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>ClosedSplineComp(SFH_ClosedBSpline*</B> <B>=</B> <B>nil)</B>
              The  constructor  takes  an  optional control point
              hit-detecting   stroked-filled   closed    B-spline
              graphic  that  defines the attributes of the closed
              spline.

       <B>SFH_ClosedBSpline*</B> <B>GetClosedSpline()</B>
              Return the SFH_ClosedBSpline graphic  that  defines
              the closed spline's attributes.  GetClosedSpline is
              simply a more specific form of the GetGraphic oper-
              ation.


</PRE>
<H2>CLOSEDSPLINEVIEW PUBLIC OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>ClosedSplineView(ClosedSplineComp*</B> <B>=</B> <B>nil)</B>
              Create a ClosedSplineView, optionally supplying the
              subject.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>Manipulator*</B> <B>CreateManipulator(</B>
          <B>Viewer*,</B> <B>Event&amp;,</B> <B>Transformer*,</B> <B>Tool*</B>
       <B>)</B>

       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>InterpretManipulator(Manipulator*)</B>
              ClosedSplineView redefines its response to  manipu-
              lation with a GraphicCompTool.  The user clicks the
              left mouse button to specify each vertex and clicks
              with  the  middle mouse button to specify the final
              vertex.  Vertex positioning will be constrained  by
              gravity,  if  any.  ClosedSplineView also defines a
              response to the ReshapeTool, allowing the  user  to
              click  on  one  of its control points to reposition
              it.   The  subject  is   actually   replaced   (via
              ReplaceCmd)  with  a  new  ClosedSplineComp subject
              reflecting the repositioned control point.  Reposi-
              tioning will be influenced by gravity.

       <B>ClosedSplineComp*</B> <B>GetClosedSplineComp()</B>
              Return the subject.


</PRE>
<H2>PSCLOSEDSPLINE PUBLIC OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
              Construct  a  PostScript external representation of
              the given subject, if any.

<H2>PSCLOSEDSPLINE PROTECTED OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>virtual</B> <B>const</B> <B>char*</B> <B>Name()</B>
              PSClosedSpline identifies itself as "CBSpl" in  the
              PostScript output.
