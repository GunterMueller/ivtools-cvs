       MatchEditor - StringEditor with string completion

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       CompletionEditor is a StringEditor subclass with the added
       ability to complete  the  current  contents  of  the  edit
       buffer  against  a  specified  set  of strings.  A Comple-
       tionEditor is often useful when  a  user  must  specify  a
       selection from a large set of well-known strings--the user
       need only type the first few characters of the string;  he
       types  the completion character to fill out the remainder.

       When the user  types  the  completion  character,  Comple-
       tionEditor  checks  the current string against the list of
       possible completions.  If the current string is  a  prefix
       of one or more completion strings, characters are appended
       so that the edit string contains the longest  common  pre-
       fix;  if  the current string does not match any completion
       string, trailing characters are removed until  the  string
       matches at least one completion.  In any case, if there is
       more than one possible completion  of  a  string,  Comple-
       tionEditor rings the workstation bell.

              <B>const</B> <B>char*</B> <B>done)</B>
              Create  a new CompletionEditor object.  The Button-
              State, sample string, and  termination  string  are
              passed to the StringEditor constructor.

              <B>char</B> <B>com-</B> <B>plete)</B>
              Specify the list of completion strings and the com-
              pletion character.  The initial completion list  is
              empty,  and  the completion character defaults to a
              space.  CompletionEditor does not copy the  strings
              in the list.
