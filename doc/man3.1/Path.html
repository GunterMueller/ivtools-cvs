<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A Path object stores a record of connectors that have been
       visited during dataflow.  Transfer functions, state  vari-
       ables, connectors, and other components can use the infor-
       mation in the path to determine  whether  data  should  be
       transmitted, for example, to avoid circular flow.
