       KeyMap  -  activates controls given their keyboard equiva-
       lents


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;Unidraw/keymap.h&gt;</B>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       KeyMap supports keyboard equivalents, which allow the user
       of  a  Unidraw  application  to  execute  menu commands or
       select from a palette of controls by  typing  rather  than
       pointing and clicking with the mouse. The KeyMap can acti-
       vate a control given its key code as defined by  its  Con-
       trolInfo  object.  Only those controls registered with the
       KeyMap can be activated through the KeyMap.   By  default,
       the  Editor  base  class  handles key events by having its
       KeyMap execute the key code.

<H2>PUBLIC OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>KeyMap()</B>
              Construct a new keymap, initially  with  no  regis-
              trants.

       <B>void</B> <B>Register(UControl*)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>Register(KeyMap*)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>Unregister(UControl*)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>Unregister(KeyMap*)</B>
              Register   and  unregister  a  control  or  another
              KeyMap.  Registering a KeyMap is equivalent to reg-
              istering  all its registered controls individually.

       <B>void</B> <B>Execute(const</B> <B>char*</B> <B>keyCode)</B>
              Execute the given key code by activating the corre-
              sponding  control.   Each  UControl contains a Con-
              trolInfo object that specifies its key  code;  thus
              the  mapping  between  key  codes  and  controls is
              defined by the  ControlInfo  objects  collectively.
              Key  codes  among  registered  controls  should  be
              unique.
