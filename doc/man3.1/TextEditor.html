       TextEditor - basic unstructured text editing

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A TextEditor is an interactor that provides an interactive
       interface for simple text editing of a TextBuffer.  TextE-
       ditor  uses  an  editing  model  based on a single current
       selection.  Editing operations operate on the text in  the
       selection, alter the position or size of the selection, or
       scroll the display  to  view  other  parts  of  the  text.
       TextEditor   interprets   a  perspective  for  interactive
       scrolling using a scroller.

       TextEditor does not provide  a  default  set  of  keyboard
       bindings.   You  can implement the key bindings you desire
       by subclassing and redefining the Handle operation  or  by
       handling keyboard events in an entirely separate class.

       <B>TextEditor(int</B> <B>rows,</B> <B>int</B> <B>cols,</B> <B>int</B> <B>tabsize,</B> <B>int</B> <B>highlight)</B>
       <B>~TextEditor()</B>
              Create or destroy an instance of  TextEditor.   The
              natural  size  of a TextEditor is specified by <I>rows</I>
              and <I>columns</I>.  The TextEditor will be tall enough to
              display <I>rows</I> lines of text in the current font, and
              it will be wide enough to display  <I>columns</I>  charac-
              ters.   For  proportionally-spaced fonts, the width
              of the character 'n' is taken to be representative.
              Tab  characters  in the text are expanded to multi-
              ples of  <I>tabsize</I>  character  widths.   The  current
              selection  highlighted  with  the  text style <I>high-</I>
              <I>light</I>.

       <B>void</B> <B>Edit(TextBuffer*,</B> <B>int</B> <B>index</B> <B>=</B> <B>0)</B>
              Specify the text buffer to  edit.   A  text  buffer
              must  be  specified  before  the TextEditor is dis-
              played.  The optional <I>index</I> parameter specifies the
              initial selection point.  If necessary, the TextEd-
              itor is scrolled so that  the  selection  point  is
              visible.

       <B>int</B> <B>Dot()</B>
       <B>int</B> <B>Mark()</B>
              The  current  selection  is  bounded by two indices
              into the text buffer.  By convention these  indices
              are  called  dot  and mark.  Dot is the position at
              which text will  be  inserted  and  deleted.   Mark
              locates  the end of the selection that moves as the
              selection is modified.  When the selection is empty
              (an insertion point), dot and mark are equal.

       <B>void</B> <B>DeleteText(int</B> <B>count)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>DeleteSelection()</B>
              Edit  the  text  buffer  at  the current selection.
              InsertText inserts  count  characters  from  string
              after  dot.   The  selection  becomes  an insertion
              point following the newly inserted  text.   Delete-
              Text  deletes count characters at dot.  If count is
              positive, the characters following dot are deleted;
              if  count is negative the characters before dot are
              deleted.  The selection becomes an insertion  point
              in  the place of the deleted text.  DeleteSelection
              deletes the text between dot and mark, changing the
              selection to an insertion point.

       <B>void</B> <B>ForwardCharacter(int</B> <B>count)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>BackwardLine(int</B> <B>count)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>ForwardLine(int</B> <B>count)</B>

       <B>void</B> <B>BackwardPage(int</B> <B>count)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>ForwardPage(int</B> <B>count)</B>
              Move  the  current selection forward or backward by
              the specified number of the specified  units.   The
              default movement is one unit.  The selection is not
              moved before the beginning of after the end of  the
              text.

       <B>void</B> <B>BeginningOfLine()</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>EndOfLine()</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>BeginningOfWord()</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>EndOfWord()</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>BeginningOfSelection()</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>EndOfSelection()</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>BeginningOfText()</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>EndOfText()</B>
              Move the current selection forwards or backwards to
              the specified feature of the text.

       <B>void</B> <B>ScrollToSelection(boolean</B> <B>always</B> <B>=</B> <B>false)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>SetScrollAlignment(Alignment)</B>
       <B>Alignment</B> <B>GetScrollAlignment()</B>
              ScrollToSelction scrolls the display  so  that  dot
              will  be  visible.  If dot is currently visible and
              <I>always</I> is false, no scrolling takes place;  if  dot
              is  not  visible  or <I>always</I> is true, the display is
              scrolled so that dot will be positioned as close as
              possible  to  the  position  specified by SetScrol-
              lAlignment.  GetScrollAlignment returns the current
              scroll alignment.  The default alignment is Center.

       <B>void</B> <B>ScrollToView(Coord</B> <B>x,</B> <B>Coord</B> <B>y)</B>
              ScrollToView scrolls the display so that  the  text
              currently  at  the position (<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>) will be visible.
              If the specified point  is  currently  visible,  no
              scrolling   takes  place.   ScrollBy  specifies  an
              amount by which to scroll  the  display.   Positive
              values scroll the display upwards and to the right.
              In each case, the final position of the display  is
              limited so that some text will be visible.

       <B>void</B> <B>GrabScroll(Event&amp;)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>RateScroll(Event&amp;)</B>
              Initiate  grab  scrolling  or rate scrolling.  Once
              called, GrabScroll (RateScroll) polls  the  current
              mouse position as long as the middle (right) button
              is pressed.  As GrabScroll polls,  it  scrolls  the
              text to follow the mouse position, making it appear
              as though the user is  dragging  the  text  itself.
              Each  time  RateScroll  polls the mouse, it scrolls
              the text by an amount corresponding to the  differ-
              ential  between the current and initial mouse posi-
              tions.  This creates the  illusion  of  a  joystick
              interface:  the  further away the mouse is from its
              initial position, the greater the scrolling  incre-
              ment  and  the  faster  the text appears to scroll;
              scrolling slows down, stops, and reverses direction
              as  the  user drags the mouse back towards and past
              the initial position.

       <B>void</B> <B>Select(int</B> <B>dot)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>Select(int</B> <B>dot,</B> <B>int</B> <B>mark)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>SelectMore(int</B> <B>mark)</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>SelectAll()</B>
              Modify the  current  selection  in  terms  of  text
              indices.   With  a  single  parameter, Select moves
              both dot and mark to the specified index.  With two
              parameters, dot and mark can be controlled indepen-
              dently.  SelectMore leaves dot unchanged and  moves
              mark.   SelectAll  sets  dot to the end of the text
              and mark to the beginning.

       <B>int</B> <B>Locate(Coord</B> <B>x,</B> <B>Coord</B> <B>y)</B>
              Return the text index  most  closely  matching  the
              point (<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>).
