       StateVarView - state variable view base class


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;Unidraw/stateview.h&gt;</B>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       StateVarView  is  the base class for state variable views.
       State variable views  provide  a  graphical  interface  to
       examining  and potentially modifying a state variable sub-
       ject.  The StateVarView base class is  an  abstract  class
       derived  from MonoScene.  Like MonoScene, the StateVarView
       class is not instantiated; instead, subclasses  add  state
       and  behavior appropriate for displaying and editing their
       subject.  Like other  MonoScene  subclasses,  StateVarView
       subclasses  use  an interactor composition to define their
       appearance.

<H2>PUBLIC OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Update()</B>
              Update the state variable view  in  response  to  a
              change  in  state it depends on (typically the sub-
              ject's).  This operation  does  not  normally  need
              redefinition  if  Init  and Stale (described below)
              are redefined.

<H2>PROTECTED OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>StateVarView(StateVar*)</B>
              Subclass constructors normally take an instance  of
              the corresponding subject as an argument.  The base
              class constructor automatically attaches  the  view
              to the subject.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Init()</B>
              Initialize  the  view  based  on information in the
              subject.   Subclasses   redefine   this   operation
              according  to  their  semantics; it does nothing by
              default.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>boolean</B> <B>Stale()</B>
              Return whether the view is in any way  inconsistent
              with  its  subject.   This operation always returns
              <I>true</I> by default; subclasses can redefine it to make
              a more discerning decision.
