       Manipulator  - base class for defining direct-manipulation
       semantics


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;Unidraw/manip.h&gt;</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Tools use manipulator objects to encapsulate the mechanics
       of  direct  manipulation.   Manipulators  turn  user input
       events into an animation sequence  that  characterize  the
       manipulation.  Manipulators abstract the manipulation into
       three phases: the <I>grasping</I>  phase,  which  occurs  at  the
       start  of  the  manipulation and lets the manipulator ini-
       tialize state it will need in later phases; the <I>manipulat-</I>
       <I>ing</I>  phase,  during  which  the  manipulator accepts input
       events and generates graphical output  that  characterizes
       successive frames of the animation; and finally the <I>effect</I>
       phase, which occurs at the end  of  the  manipulation  and
       lets  the  manipulator finalize its state.  Manipulator is
       an abstract  base  class.   Subclasses  support  different
       manipulation semantics.

<H2>MANIPULATOR PUBLIC OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Grasp(Event&amp;)</B>
              Grasp  is  called  once  at the beginning of direct
              manipulation to allow the manipulator to initialize
              its internal state based on the initiating event.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>boolean</B> <B>Manipulating(Event&amp;)</B>
              Manipulating is called repeatedly during the manip-
              ulation whenever a  new  event  arrives,  until  it
              returns  false.   Each  call to Manipulating should
              produce a new frame of the animation  that  charac-
              terizes the manipulation.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Effect(Event&amp;)</B>
              Effect  is called once at the end of direct manipu-
              lation to allow the  manipulator  to  finalize  its
              internal  state based on the last event supplied to
              the Manipulating operation.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>SetViewer(Viewer*)</B>
       <B>virtual</B> <B>Viewer*</B> <B>GetViewer()</B>
       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>SetTool(Tool*)</B>
       <B>virtual</B> <B>Tool*</B> <B>GetTool()</B>
              Get and set the viewer, in  which  the  manipulator
              generates  graphical output, and the tool that cre-
              ated the manipulator.  These operations do  nothing
              by  default;  subclasses that require this informa-
              tion must redefine these operations to  assign  and
              retrieve the state they require.

       <B>Manipulator()</B>
              The constructor is protected to disallow instantia-
              tion of abstract base class objects.
