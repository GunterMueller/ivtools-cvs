</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;Unidraw/Tools/tool.h&gt;</B>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Tool  is  an  abstract base class for objects that support
       direct manipulation of components.  Tools employ animation
       and  other  visual effects for immediate feedback to rein-
       force the user's perception that he is dealing  with  real
       objects.   The  user <I>grasps</I> and <I>wields</I> a tool to achieve a
       desired <I>effect</I>.  The effect may involve a change to one or
       more  components' internal state, or it may change the way
       components are viewed, or there may be no  effect  at  all
       (if  for  example the tool is used in an inapropriate con-
       text).

       Conceptually, tools do their work within viewers, in which
       graphical  component  views are displayed and manipulated.
       Whenever a viewer receives an input event (such as a mouse
       click  or  key  press),  it  in turn asks the current tool
       (defined by the enclosing  editor  object)  to  produce  a
       manipulator  object. A tool implements its CreateManipula-
       tor operation to  create  and  initialize  an  appropriate
       manipulator,  which  encapsulates  the tool's manipulation
       semantics by defining  the  three  phases  (grasp,  wield,
       effect)  of  the manipulation.  Moreover, a tool can dele-
       gate manipulator creation to one or  more  of  the  Graph-
       icView  objects  in the viewer to allow component-specific
       interaction.   A  tool's  InterpretManipulator   operation
       accesses  and analyzes information in the manipulator that
       characterizes the manipulation and then creates a  command
       that  carries out the desired effect.  If a tool delegated
       manipulator creation to a graphical  view,  then  it  must
       delegate its interpretation to the same view.

          <B>Viewer*,</B> <B>Event&amp;,</B> <B>Transformer*</B>
       <B>)</B>

       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>InterpretManipulator(Manipulator*)</B>
              Operations  that define how the tool reacts when it
              is used and its  ultimate  effect.   The  tool  can
              defer  manipulator creation and interpretation to a
              GraphicView.  This allows the same tool  to  behave
              differently  depending  on the component it manipu-
              lates.


              CreateManipulator creates  a  manipulator  that  is
              appropriate  for  the tool.  It receives the viewer
              sary, and the coordinate transformation  that  maps
              canvas  coordinates  into  the subject's coordinate
              space.  InterpretManipulator  is  called  following
              manipulation and defines how to construct a command
              that carries out the manipulation's desired effect.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>SetControlInfo(ControlInfo*)</B>
       <B>virtual</B> <B>ControlInfo*</B> <B>GetControlInfo()</B>
              Tools use a ControlInfo object to store information
              from which to build a user interface  for  engaging
              the  tool.   These  operations set and get the Con-
              trolInfo object.  SetControlInfo  does  <I>not</I>  delete
              the ControlInfo being replaced.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>Component*</B> <B>Copy()</B>
              Return a copy of the tool.  Subclasses should rede-
              fine this operation to return an instance of  their
              type.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Read(istream&amp;)</B>
       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>Write(ostream&amp;)</B>
              Read  and  write the tool's contents to a stream to
              support catalog operations.  Read and  write  typi-
              cally   call  first  the  corresponding  operations
              defined by their parent class, and then  they  read
              or write their class-specific state.  Note that you
              must ensure that the objects are read in  the  same
              order they are written.

       <B>virtual</B> <B>ClassId</B> <B>GetClassId()</B>
       <B>virtual</B> <B>boolean</B> <B>IsA(ClassId)</B>
              GetClassId  returns the unique class identifier for
              the Tool subclass, while IsA  returns  whether  the
              instance is of a class or subclass corresponding to
              the given identifier.   IsA  typically  checks  the
              given  identifier  against  the  instance's own (as
              defined by its GetClassId operation)  and,  failing
              that, calls its parent classes' IsA operation.  All
              subclasses must  redefine  GetClassId  and  IsA  to
              ensure  that  their identifiers are unique and that
              instances are written and read properly.

<H2>PROTECTED OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>Tool(ControlInfo*</B> <B>=</B> <B>nil)</B>
              The constructor is protected to  prevent  instatia-
              tion  of  the abstract base class.  The ControlInfo
              object is optional, but only  tools  that  have  no
              visible  manifestion  in  the interface should omit
              it.

       <B>ControlInfo*</B> <B>CopyControlInfo()</B>
              CopyControlInfo is a convenience function that sub-
              it  non-nil,  simply  checking  for  a nil argument
              before calling the corresponding Copy on  the  Con-
              trolInfo object.
