       RpcService - support RPC between a service and its clients


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;Dispatch/rpcservice.h&gt;</B>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       An RpcService (actually, an instance of a  derived  class)
       creates  a  port  and  listens  to it for connections from
       clients.  When a client opens a connection, the RpcService
       will  create a reader to handle RPC requests from the con-
       nection.

<H2>CONSTRUCTORS</H2><PRE>
       <B>RpcService(int</B> <B>port)</B>
       <B>RpcService(const</B> <B>char*</B> <B>path,</B> <B>int</B> <B>port</B> <B>=</B> <B>0)</B>
              Start up an RPC service.  If a filename  is  given,
              record  the  RPC service's hostname and port number
              in it so  clients  can  contact  the  service.   If
              ``port'' is zero, the next free port number will be
              used.


</PRE>
<H2>PUBLIC OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>void</B> <B>run()</B>
       <B>void</B> <B>quitRunning()</B>
              Read RPC  requests  continuously  until  ``quitRun-
              ning()''  terminates  the  loop.   If  you're using
              InterViews, you don't have to call ``run()''  since
              the  InterViews  event-reading  code will also read
              RPC requests.


</PRE>
<H2>PROTECTED OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> <B>createReader(int</B> <B>fd)</B> <B>=</B> <B>0</B>
              You must define this function in a derived class in
              order  to  start  servicing RPC requests from a new
              client.  Typically all you have to do  is  to  con-
              struct  a  reader  using the passed file descriptor
              and make the reader responsible for deleting itself
              when it notices that the connection has been closed
              by the client.
