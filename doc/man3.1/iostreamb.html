       istreamb, ostreamb, iostreamb - unformatted streams


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;Dispatch/iostreamb.h&gt;</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       istreamb,  ostreamb,  and  iostreamb are streams just like
       istream, ostream, and iostream except  for  two  features.
       First,  they  automatically  insert and extract delimiters
       around datums where necessary so you never have  to  sepa-
       rate  datums  by  whitespace  yourself.   Second, they can
       insert and extract integers as either unformatted (binary)
       bytes  or  formatted  characters  so you can eliminate the
       time needed to convert integers to strings and back.  Both
       of  these  features  make these classes easier to use than
       the base stream classes  for  inter-process  communication
       (IPC).
