       Pattern - fill patterns


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;InterViews/pattern.h&gt;</B>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A pattern defines how to fill areas during graphics opera-
       tions.  A pattern is essentially a mask for  drawing  that
       is replicated to fill the size of the destination.

       N.B.: Patterns are relatively low-level objects, typically
       used to implement an alpha value for a color.   Since  the
       color object now supports an alpha value, there is no need
       to use patterns.

<H2>PUBLIC OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>Pattern()</B>
              Create a solid pattern.

       <B>Pattern(char*,</B> <B>unsigned</B> <B>int</B> <B>width,</B> <B>unsigned</B> <B>int</B> <B>height)</B>
              Create a pattern with the given width  and  height,
              using the bits described by the first parameter.

       <B>Pattern(int)</B>
              Create a 4x4 pattern determined from the least sig-
              nificant 16 bits of the parameter.

       <B>Pattern(int*)</B>
              Construct a 16x16  pattern  from  the  given  data.
              This  function is provided solely for backward com-
              patibility and will be removed in the future.

       <B>Pattern(Bitmap*)</B>
              Construct a pattern from the bitmap.  If necessary,
              the  bitmap  will  be tiled or truncated to satisfy
              window system requirements for fill pattern  sizes.
