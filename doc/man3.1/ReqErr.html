       ReqErr - handle request errors

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Some  requests to the window server may generate an error.
       For example, if a window is destroyed while  it  is  being
       repositioned  interactively, the request to place the win-
       dow in the new position will fail.  Normally, errors cause
       a  process to terminate.  The ReqErr class is used to han-
       dle errors within an application.  The base class  defines
       the  attributes  associated  with  each error, including a
       <I>message</I> string describing the error,  an  integer  <I>request</I>
       code  that  specifies  the kind of call that generated the
       error, and a <I>id</I> object that was the target of the request.
       When  an  error  occurs,  the  attributes  of  the current
       request handler are assigned and the handler's Error oper-
       ation is called.
