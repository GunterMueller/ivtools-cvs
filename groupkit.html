    <h1>GroupKit1.0 from the University of Calgary</h1>

    Sometime in 1998, an attempt was made, for reasons of software
    archaelogical curiosity, to build GroupKit1.0 from the University
    of Calgary on top of <a href=./index.html>ivtools</a>.  This
    version of GroupKit, from Mark Roseman and Saul Greenberg, was
    delivered on top of the third beta release of InterViews 3.1,
    published in 1990.  Subsequent versions were written on top of
    Tcl/Tk.<p>

     GroupKit1.0 relied extensively on the Dispatch class library, and
     the use of binary iostreams for distributed communication.
     Subsequent evolutions to either the Dispatch library or the
     iostreams library (at least the libstdc++ version) seem to have
     disabled GroupKit1.0.  The assumption that might be the problem
     was the technique of pushing bytes back onto an incoming binary
     socket stream as a way of managing distributed communication.<p>

      Because of the scientific free software ethic involved, all
      components are still available for investigation and/or fixing
      if anyone is so motivated.  Alternates to the Dispatch library,
      like <a href=http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html>ACE</a>
      from <a href=http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt>Doug Schmidt</a>,
      now exist, but it is possible that this original approach
      attempted by programmers at the University of Calgary might
      still be viable if upgraded to the latest capability of
      iostreams.  With it comes one pile of C++ software applicable to
      multi-media conferencing.<p>

      Here is a <a href=./gk1.0-ivtools.patch>patch</a> which upgrades
      GroupKit1.0 to build on <a href=./index.html>ivtools</a>.<p>
