A <a href=http://www.vectaport.com/pub/src/pstoedit-idrawrast.patch.txt>patch</a> is available to add raster support to the idraw output format of pstoedit.  Should work on pstoedit-3.14, pstoedit-3.15, and pstoedit-3.16.  It was incorporated into pstoedit-3.17 by Wolfgang Glunz.

A 2nd <a href=http://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/pstoedit.3.30.idraw.patch.txt>patch</a> is available to improve raster support for the idraw output format of pstoedit. Now you enter "drawtool -" directly into the print dialog box of Netscape and have the PostScript rendered directly into the drawing editor. Should work on pstoedit-3.30 and be incorporated in pstoedit-3.31.

PSTOEDIT <br>
Copyright (C) 1993,1994,1995,1996,1997 Wolfgang Glunz, Wolfgang.Glunz@mchp.siemens.de<br>
<br>
pstoedit converts Postscript(TM) and PDF files to other vector graphic<br>
formats so that they can be edited graphically. See pstoedit.man or<br>
manual.html for more details on which formats are supported by pstoedit.<br>
<br>
The architecture of pstoedit consists of a PostScript frontend which<br>
needs to call a PostScript interpreter like Ghostscript and the<br>
individual backends which are plugged into a kind of framework.<br>
<br>
This framework can be used independently from the PostScript frontend<br>
from any other program. The framework provides a uniform interface to<br>
all different backends. Get in contact with the author if you need<br>
more information on how to use this framework.<br>

    It is used by the barplot command of <a
    href=./comdraw.html>comdraw</a>.  This uses both 
    <a href=./plotmtv.html>plotmtv</a> to generate the plot in PostScript, and pstoedit 
    to re-render it in idraw-formatted PostScript.
