ivtools-0.7.3 is now available at http://www.vectaport.com/ivtools/.
This release makes for greatly expanded documentation -- online,
offline, and inline (see http://www.vectaport.com/ivtools/doc/):

   - inline header-file comments extractable by PERCEPS 
     (http://friga.mer.utexas.edu/mark/perl/perceps/)
     for these class libraries:  

	Attribute 
	ComTerp 
	OverlayUnidraw
	GraphUnidraw

   - links from library overview web pages to individual class
     web pages generated by PERCEPS 
     (i.e. http://www.vectaport.com/ivtools/ovinfo.html)

   - all the man pages and the reference manual from InterViews 3.1,
     partially cross-referenced with the PERCEPS generated web pages.

   - derived class graph in HTML generated with a new argument "-d" 
     argument on iclass.  Try it on your own inheritance trees.

This release also contains a lot of dialog box hacking
(export/print/attribute/precise-page) and a rudimentary dataflow
mechanism added to ivtools graphdraw.  And it adds support for
floating-point line widths to idraw, the first step in implementing a
new idraw format version 11 for added compatibility with GNU
plotutils. For more details see:
