    <h3>import from pbmplus image processing filters to ivtools</h3>

    pbmplus is a collection of image processing filters written by Jef
    Poskanzer.  It supports three image formats: pbm (portable
    bitmap), pgm (portable graymap), and ppm (portable pixmap) with an
    ASCII and binary variant of each.<p>

    netpbm-mar1994 was a subsequent distribution of the same free
    software augmented by contributed filters and formats.  <a
    href=./netpbm-1mar1994-free.tar.gz>
    netpbm-1mar1994-free.tar.gz</a> (from a <a
    href=http://www.redhat.com/i>Red Hat</a> source RPM) is a subset
    of this distribution where the only contribution with an
    unworkable license (hpcdtoppm.c) was removed.     <p>

    ivtools <a href=./editors.html>drawing editors</a> support the
    import of all six pbmplus formats (pgm/pgm/ppm in ASCII and
    binary).  The pathname of these image files can be entered
    directly into the string editor of the import dialog box, or if
    the "from command" checkbox is set, an arbitrary command line
    can be entered that generates a pbmplus image format. <p>

      A wider variety of raster formats is supported by use of the
      "anytopnm" script, of which a modified and improved copy is
      incorporated directly into ivtools.<p>



    Linux binaries for netbpm and pbmplus available from 
    <a href=http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/graphics/convert/!INDEX.short.html>sunsite.unc.edu</a>
    and other Linux distributions.<p>

    A revived version of the Netpbm repackaging of pbmplus can be found at 
    <a href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/netpbm/>http://sourceforge.net/projects/netpbm/</a><p>
