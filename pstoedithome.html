pstoedit translates PostScript and PDF graphics into other vector formats. 
Currently pstoedit can generate the following formats:

<UL>
<LI>    Tgif .obj format (for tgif version &gt;= 3)
<LI>    (Frame)Maker Intermediate Format
<LI>    .fig format for xfig
<LI>    pdf - Adobe's Portable Document Format
<LI>    gnuplot format
<LI>    Flattened PostScript
<LI>    OS/2 meta files (under OS/2 only)
<LI>    Windows meta files (WMF) (under DOS/Windows only)
<LI>    DXF - CAD exchange format
<LI>    CGM Format binary and textual
<LI>    LWO - LightWave 3D
<LI>	RIB - RenderMan
<LI>	RPL - Real3D
<LI>	Java applet
<LI>	Idraw format
</UL>
Implementing support for other formats should be very easy. 

The architecture of pstoedit consists of a PostScript frontend which
needs to call a PostScript interpreter like Ghostscript and the
individual backends which are pugged into a kind of framework.

This framework can be used independently from the PostScript frontend
from any other program. The framework provides a uniform interface to
all different backends.

You need a C++ compiler to install and GhostScript to run pstoedit.
pstoedit should run on all Un*x like systems and has also been ported
to OS/2, DOS/Windows, and RiscOS.

<H2>New or changed in 2.60:</H2>
<LI> 	New backend for idraw contributed by Scott Pakin <pakin@cs.uiuc.edu>
<LI>	Internal redesign in order to support the usage of the drivers from 
	other programs, not just from pstoedit. 
<LI>	Full implementation of kshow, xshow, yshow, xyshow

<H2>New or changed in 2.50:</H2>

<UL>
<LI>	New backend for WMF, contributed by Jens Weber (wr@lzh1.lzh.de)
<LI>	Windows GUI, contributed by Jens Weber (wr@lzh1.lzh.de)
<LI>	direct handling of .pdf files (as input) (Thanks to ghostscript

	 for taking care of this linux specific problem and the workaround)
<LI>	fixed a bug with ordering of text and lines
<LI>	replaced usage of tmpnam by tempnam so the user can
