Instructions for building MixViews on Linux with a default-configured
ivtools-0.6.10 or greater:

0. acquire and unpack the latest version of MixViews in a new directory:

  ftp://ftp.ccmrc.ucsb.edu/pub/MixViews/source/mxv-current-source.tar.gz

1. comment out the definition of APP_CCINCLUDES in MixView's Imakefile
(line 194) and change the ARCH_CCLDLIBS at line 135 to use -lg++ and
not use -lieee.

2. add an "int MAIN__;" near the top of main.C to work around a global
symbol required by libf2c.

3. change line 78 of ivtools-0.6/config/local.def from:

#definition IvToolsSrcRoot $(TOP)

to:

#definition IvToolsSrcRoot ProjectDir/ivtools-0.6

and make sure ProjectDir in site.def.LINUX is the directory in which
sits ivtools-0.6.  Then regenerate the ivmkmf script file by cd'ing to
ivtools-0.6/src/scripts, deleting ivmkmf, and doing a "make install".

4. Then run the ivtools ivmkmf with -a from that MixViews source
directory (make sure your CPU environment variable is set to LINUX --
ignore the make depend errors):

  ivmkmf -a

5. then do a make, ignoring the warnings from gcc:

  make -k

information on obtaining and building MixViews.
