Aaron the flying anteater is a member of a new species of aardvark
evolved for domestic ant-control.  With greatly extended scapula, he
(and the rest of myrmecophaga aerialosi) have the ability to hover
around furniture and potted plants (especially rubber-trees), waiting
for the ants to track by.

<p>

He is a general purpose hard working character around these web pages.
Ant-control is his main line of business, but he moonlights as a
mascot for software packages every so often.

He still thinks it just might get him some exposure for his night job,
as an actor in <a href=http://www.vectaport.com/flipbooks/>animated
shorts</a>.  The following are stills from his work.
