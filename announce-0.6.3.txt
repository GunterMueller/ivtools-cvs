Subject: ivtools-0.6.3: drawing editor frameworks with XFree86 style license

ivtools is a collection of sample drawing editors that exercise and
demonstrate the capabilities of their underlying C++ class libraries.
It comes with an XFree86 style, non-copylefted freeware license, and
is available for use in any commercial or free software effort.

ivtools-0.6.3, the latest release, is available at:
http://www.vectaport.com/pub/src/ivtools-0.6.3.tgz

ivtools was built by augmenting the libraries of InterViews 3.1 with
new libraries that extend the idraw framework and add features like a
node-graph editor, a multi-frame editor, and a script-based
interpreter.

We've tested the backward compatibility of ivtools with the original
InterViews and Unidraw by building significant third-party packages
like Target Jr and MixViews on top. More information at:
