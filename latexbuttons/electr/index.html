<title>Electronics with IVtools: Building complex electrical circuits with a basic widget set and comdraw</title>

<h1>
ivtools Circ-widgets
</h1>
<b>ivtools Circ-widgets</b> is a set of electrical building blocks such as resistors, inductors,
capacitors, and/or, nan/nor gates, etc for building both analog and digital electrical
circuits.

<p>
The symbols can be lined up with dashed lines as in the chemical example (see Chem-widgets).
To draw in the wire, simply use 2 dashed colored lines, and follow as closely with a multi-
segment line.

<b>LaTeX:</b> To include the graphic in a LaTeX document, simply export it as encapsulated 
PostScript (EPS) by choosing File::Export Graphic. Click on "EPS", then click on "Export".
Then insert the following before the \begin{document} line in your
LaTeX document:<p>
<code>
\input psfig.sty<br>
</code>
<p>

To display the graphic, insert the following in the body of your LaTeX code:<p>

<code>
\begin{figure}[htbp] <br>
     \psfig{file=file.ps,width=6in,height=3in} % see Kenneth Shultis, pp. 100-103<br>
 \end{figure}
</code>
<p>
Where file.ps is the name of your graphic; there cannot be any extraneous spaces inside
the braces on the \psfig line. See Ken Shultis' book "LaTeX NOTES: Practical Tips for Preparing Technical Documents", ISBN: 0-13-120973-6

The <b>IVtools custom toolbar</b> allows one to load custom toolbar configurations for different
typesetting projects. Instead of loading all of the possible electrical widgets, and believe me
there are alot, only load the ones required for the project at hand, or the ones you find most useful.
One could even have 2 toolbars: one analog and one digital.
To build a custom toolbar, write a toolbar script similar to this:
<p>
addtool("/usr/guest/todd/graphics/IVTOOLS/ToolBars/Electrical-toolbar/widgets/meter.idraw" :popen)
addtool("/usr/guest/todd/graphics/IVTOOLS/ToolBars/Electrical-toolbar/widgets/resistor.idraw" :popen)
addtool("/usr/guest/todd/graphics/IVTOOLS/ToolBars/Electrical-toolbar/widgets/inductor.idraw" :popen)
addtool("/usr/guest/todd/graphics/IVTOOLS/ToolBars/Electrical-toolbar/widgets/switch.idraw" :popen)
<p>

<b> NOTE:</b> To be as flexible as possible I deliberately left the letter out of the meter widget.
To get an ammeter, click on the meter icon, do Structure::Ungroup, and then modify it by adding
an "A", and then do Structure::Group to regroup the new widget. You can now stick the ammeter in the
diagram where desired. The same procedure is used to create a galvanometer and voltmeter :-) .
