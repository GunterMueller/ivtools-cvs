<title>Feynman Diagrams with IVtools: Doing particle physics with a basic widget set and comdraw</title>

<h1>
ivtools Feynman-widgets
</h1>


Feynman diagrams are used in many branches of physics, to show how to organize the various
calculational contributions of various elementary processes. The <b>ivtools Feynman-widgets</b> 
is a set of graphical widgets that allow one to build these diagrams in a GUI environment
such as <b>Comdraw</b> and then export the finished diagram as PostScript for inclusion
into a technical paper via LaTeX and <b>psfig</b> macro.
<P>
The basic set of widgets used to build Feynman diagrams is listed in <i>The LaTeX Graphics
Companion, p. 233</i> by Goosens, et al. (ISBN: 0-201-85469-4) . Below is an example of a 
Feynman diagram:
<h1>
<img align=middle src="./feynman-fig1.jpeg" >
</h1>

<p>
You start by first constructing an enlarged version of the middle wavy line. You use a 
large colored line to keep both wave pieces even. Then you disclose the wave using
Structure::Ungroup several times, the resulting wave should look like this:
<h1>
<img align=middle src="./feynman-fig2.jpeg" >
</h1>
<p>
Then use scale to shrink the wave; adding arrows, and vectors and symbols like
so:
<h1>
<img align=middle src="./feynman-fig3.jpeg" >
</h1>

<p>
The last step, after selecting the completed structure, is to select Structure::Ungroup
from the IVtools menu 2 or 3 times. You then reselect the completed structure and select
Structure::Group from the IVtools menu. This will give you the result in Fig. 3 above.

Since the structure is now treated as 1 large object, you can reposition it by selecting
it, and then moving the mouse while holding down the middle-mouse button.

<p>
Here ia a more complex, finished example:
<h1>
<img align=middle src="./feynman-fig4.jpeg" >
</h1>
<p>
To include this structure in a technical paper or journal article, simply export it as
encapsulated PostScript (EPS) by choosing File::Export Graphic. Click on "EPS", then
click on "Export". Then insert the following before the \begin{document} line in your
LaTeX document:<p>
<code>
\input psfig.sty<br>
</code>
<p>
To display the graphic, insert the following in the body of your LaTeX code:<p>

<code>
 \begin{figure}[htbp] <br>
     \psfig{file=file.ps,width=6in,height=3in} % see Kenneth Shultis, pp. 100-103<br>
 \end{figure}
</code>
<p>
Where file.ps is the name of your graphic; there cannot be any extraneous spaces inside
the braces on the \psfig line. See Ken Shultis' book "LaTeX NOTES: Practical Tips for Preparing Technical Documents", ISBN: 0-13-120973-6

The <b>IVtools custom toolbar</b> allows one to load custom toolbar configurations for different
typesetting projects. Instead of loading all of the possible chemical widgets, and believe me
there are alot, only load the ones required for the project at hand, or the ones you find most useful.
To build a custom toolbar, write a toolbar script similar to this:
<p>
addtool("/usr/guest/todd/graphics/IVTOOLS/ToolBars/FEYNMAN/widgets/wiggly.idraw")     <br>
addtool("/usr/guest/todd/graphics/IVTOOLS/ToolBars/FEYNMAN/widgets/zigzag.idraw")     <br>
addtool("/usr/guest/todd/graphics/IVTOOLS/ToolBars/FEYNMAN/widgets/dbl_wiggly.idraw") <br>
addtool("/usr/guest/todd/graphics/IVTOOLS/ToolBars/FEYNMAN/widgets/dbl_zigzag.idraw") <br>
addtool("/usr/guest/todd/graphics/IVTOOLS/ToolBars/FEYNMAN/widgets/arrow.idraw")      <br>
addtool("/usr/guest/todd/graphics/IVTOOLS/ToolBars/FEYNMAN/widgets/circle.idraw")     <br>
addtool("/usr/guest/todd/graphics/IVTOOLS/ToolBars/FEYNMAN/widgets/tetragram.idraw")  <br>
<p>
To load the desired toolbar click on Tools::Custom Tools. This will give a stripped down Comdraw
toolbar into which custom widgets can be inserted. To load the custom widgets, click into the 
Comdraw command window, and enter the following command:<p>
run ("$PATH/file")
<p>
Where $PATH is the complete path to the custom toolbar script and "file" is the name of the script.
<p>
<b>The Feynman widgets must be in idraw format</b> to be added to the toolbar in this manner.
To convert a widget to idraw format for use in the toolbar:<p>
<ul>

    <li>Import the desired graphic</li> <br>
    <li>Select from the menu File::Export Graphic</li><br>
    <li>Choose "idraw EPS"</li> <br>
    <li>Click on the Export button </li><br>

</ul>
<p>
<b>Adding Fonts to IVtools for technical Typesetting: </b>
As you can see from the complex example, Fig. 4, it would be useful to add Greek chars to
the Idraw/Comdraw/Drawserv Font menus. The best example I have found of this is given in
<a name=fonthelp href=http://cns-web.bu.edu/pub/paolo/arvo-titles/idraw-help.html name=minimal>Minimal
idraw help</a> (also listed at the bottom of the idraw page). The basic process:
 <ol>
 <li> Edit your .Xresources or .Xdefaults file by adding:
comdraw.font12:-adobe-symbol-*-*-*-*-*-100-*-*-*-*-*-* Symbol 10 <br>
comdraw.font13:-adobe-symbol-*-*-*-*-*-120-*-*-*-*-*-* Symbol 12 <br>
comdraw.font14:-adobe-symbol-*-*-*-*-*-140-*-*-*-*-*-* Symbol 14 <br>
comdraw.font15:-adobe-symbol-*-*-*-*-*-180-*-*-*-*-*-* Symbol 18 <br>
 </li>
 <li> Save the file and execute:
  xrdb -load ~/.Xresources        (or if you are using .Xdefaults, xrdb -load ~/.Xdefaults)
      </li>
 <li> Shutdown and restart the X server and restart Comdraw/Idraw
 </li>
 </ol>
