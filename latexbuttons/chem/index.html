<title>Chemistry with IVtools: Building complex chemical structures with a basic widget set and comdraw</title>

<h1>
ivtools Chem-widgets
</h1>

<b>ivtools Chem-widgets</b> is a set of chemical building blocks such as simple rings,
polycyclic rings, and a porphoryn ring for building your own chemical structures
to be used in LaTeX documents etc. Many of these structures such as benzene, c4, c5, c6,
and c7 have removable angle vertexes making the contruction of heterocycles a snap.
Below is an example showing how the build the complex molecule adenosine-triphosphate
(ATP). The following examples were all done with comdraw.
<p>
We start with a ring system and create 2 colored, dashed lines and a bunch of required
symbols. We then use the dashed lines to align the single bonds and symbols like so:
<h1>
<img align=middle src="./chem-fig1.jpeg" >
</h1>
When we have everything in its place, we then get rid of any extraneous symbols, lines,
glyphs, etc. and select the completed structure by pressing the left mouse button
(Mouse-1) and dragging across the structure diagonally. The selected chemical should
similar to Fig. 2.
<h1>
<img align=middle src="./chem-fig2.jpeg" >
</h1>
<p>
The last step, after selecting the completed structure, is to select Structure::Ungroup
from the IVtools menu 2 or 3 times. You then reselect the completed structure and select
Structure::Group from the IVtools menu. This will give you the result in Fig. 3 below.
<h1>

</h1>
Since the structure is now treated as 1 large object, you can reposition it by selecting
it, and then moving the mouse while holding the middle button down.

<p>
To include this structure in a technical paper or journal article, simply export it as
encapsulated PostScript (EPS) by choosing File::Export Graphic. Click on "EPS", then
click on "Export". Then insert the following before the \begin{document} line in your
LaTeX document:<p>
<code>
\input psfig.sty<br>
</code>
<p>
To display the graphic, insert the following in the body of your LaTeX code:<p>

<code>
 \begin{figure}[htbp] <br>
     \psfig{file=file.ps,width=6in,height=3in} % see Kenneth Shultis, pp. 100-103<br>
 \end{figure}
</code>
<p>
Where file.ps is the name of your graphic; there cannot be any extraneous spaces inside
the braces on the \psfig line. See Ken Shultis' book "LaTeX NOTES: Practical Tips for Preparing Technical Documents", ISBN: 0-13-120973-6

<b>IVtools does Curvey-arrows</b><br>
"Curvey arrow notation" is an official notation used by chemists for specifiying
chemical mechanisms by showing where the electrons go based on Lewis Acid-Base and 
VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theories, and the Octet Rule.
<p>
A very simple example of this is the resonance structure of 4-nitrophenol:
<h1>
<img align=middle src="./nitrophenol1_2.jpeg" >
</h1><h1>
<img align=middle src="./nitrophenol2_2.jpeg">
</h1>
<p>

<b>IVtools and heterocycles:</b>
The cyclical structures cyclobutane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, benzene, cycloheptane, and
cyclooctane were designed with removable angle vertexes making construction of heterocycles a
snap:

<img align=middle src="./pyridine2.jpeg">
</h1>
<p>

The <b>IVtools custom toolbar</b> allows one to load custom toolbar configurations for different
typesetting projects. Instead of loading all of the possible chemical widgets, and believe me
there are alot, only load the ones required for the project at hand, or the ones you find most useful.
To build a custom toolbar, write a toolbar script similar to this:
<p>
addtool("/usr/guest/todd/graphics/IVTOOLS/ToolBars/Chem-Toolbar/widgets/c5-ring.idraw" :popen)
addtool("/usr/guest/todd/graphics/IVTOOLS/ToolBars/Chem-Toolbar/widgets/c6-ring.idraw" :popen)
addtool("/usr/guest/todd/graphics/IVTOOLS/ToolBars/Chem-Toolbar/widgets/phenyl.idraw" :popen)
addtool("/usr/guest/todd/graphics/IVTOOLS/ToolBars/Chem-Toolbar/widgets/c7-ring.idraw" :popen)
addtool("/usr/guest/todd/graphics/IVTOOLS/ToolBars/Chem-Toolbar/widgetsc/8-ring.idraw" :popen)

addtool("/usr/guest/todd/graphics/IVTOOLS/ToolBars/Chem-Toolbar/widgets/c6-boat.idraw" :popen)
addtool("/usr/guest/todd/graphics/IVTOOLS/ToolBars/Chem-Toolbar/widgets/c6-chair.idraw" :popen)
addtool("/usr/guest/todd/graphics/IVTOOLS/ToolBars/Chem-Toolbar/widgets/t-butyl.idraw" :popen)
<p>
To load the desired toolbar click on Tools::Custom Tools. This will give a stripped down toolbar
into which custom widgets can be inserted. To load the custom widgets, click into the Comdraw
command window, and enter the following command:<p>
run ("$PATH/file")
<p>
Where $PATH is the complete path to the custom toolbar script and "file" is the name of the script.
<p>
<b>The chemistry widgets must be in idraw format</b> to be added to the toolbar in this manner.
To convert a widget to idraw format for use in the toolbar:<p>
<ul>

    <li>Import the desired graphic</li> <br>
    <li>Select from the menu File::Export Graphic</li><br>
    <li>Choose "idraw EPS"</li> <br>
    <li>Click on the Export button </li><br>

</ul>
<p>
Below is a shot of the comdraw GUI with chem widgets loaded:

As an aside, I have also built a <b>protein widget set</b>, for use in amino-acid sequencing,
building biomolecules etc. Here is a comparison of the first 15 amino-acid residues that comprise
3 different kinds of haemoglobin found in the sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus:
